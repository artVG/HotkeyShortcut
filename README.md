# HotkeyShortcut

Alt + F11 to switch to hotkey mode
config file must be in the same folder with "HotkeyShortcut.exe" and must be named "hkConfig.txt"
in config: 
- comment line must start with '#'
- commnd line structure "KEYNAME one space FUNCTIONNAME one space COMMANDDATA"

Available functions for now:

- because of using Alt for hotkey mode activation first letter in STRING sometimes not printed. 
(click with mouse to the place you want to print input after Alt + F11 but before hotkey)
